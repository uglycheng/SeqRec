# SeqRec
This is a course project of UCSD CSE 258 with Prof Julian McAuley. In this project, we implemented three baseline recommendation models and two state-of-the-art models FPMC and SASRec on the sequential recommendation task. We explored two datasets with diï¿¿erent density, Google Local Reviews and MovieLens-1M.
